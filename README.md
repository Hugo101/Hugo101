- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Ph.D. in the field of Deep Learning, with a focus on **low-resource learning (meta/few-shot/semi/self-supervised learning)**, **robustness**, and **uncertainty estimation** at the University of Texas at Dallas. I was a research intern at **[Meta AI]()** and **[Bosch Center for AI]()**. During my tenure at Meta AI, I contributed to a multimodal recurring transfer learning project. Subsequently, at BCAI, I focused on the sparsity of the **Multimodal Foundation Models**. 
- ðŸŒ± My goal is to ensure AI systems safe, robust, reliable and trustworthy. Iâ€™m also very interested in **Generative AI** (large language models (LLMs), and diffusion models), and exploring along these directions.
- ðŸ‘¯ **Iâ€™m looking for internship opportunities for Spring/Summer 2024, and seeking full-time roles for 2024**.
